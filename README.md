**How to start?**

1. Install -> [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
2. Install -> [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
3. Download project with git -> `git clone https://github.com/svipben/react-boilerplate.git`
4. Go to the directory where you downloaded the project
5. Install all needed packages -> `yarn init-packages`
6. Launch development server -> `yarn dev`
7. That's it, you're ready to develop apps faster than ever before!
8. Not necessary, but you can edit `package.json`, `src/assets/humans.txt` and `README.md`

**Project structure:**
- `.vscode` - VS Code workspace settings
    - `launch.json` - VS Code debug configuration
- `build` - compiled src (server & client)
- `node_modules` - Node.js packages
- **`src/assets`** - static files (e.g. fonts, images, etc.)
    - `fonts`
    - `images`
    - `humans.txt` - contains information about the people who have contributed to building the app
    - `robots.txt` - gives instructions about app to web robots
- **`src/client`** - front-end
    - `app` - main client files
        - `app.css` - main CSS which need to be used inside `app.jsx`
        - `app.jsx` - main component which contains other React components (e.g. header, footer, navbar, etc.)
    - `client.js` - client entry point (renders `app/app.jsx` with ReactDOM)
- **`src/server`** - back-end
    - `config.js` - server configuration (e.g. port, hostname, etc.)
    - `server.js` - server entry point (starts app with Express framework)
- **`webpack`** - webpack configurations
    - `dev.config.js` - development configuration
    - `dev.server.js` - development server
    - `prod.config.js` - production configuration
- `.babelrc` - Babel configuration
- `.eslintrc.json` - ESLint configuration
- `.flowconfig` - Flow configuration
- `.gitignore` - specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore
- `.stylelintrc.json` - stylelint configuration
- `package.json` - various metadata relevant to the project
- `README.md` - project description
