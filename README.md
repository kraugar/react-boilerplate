**How to start?**

1. Install -> [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
2. Install -> [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
3. Install -> [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
4. Download project with git -> `git clone https://github.com/svipben/react-boilerplate.git`
5. Go to the directory where you downloaded the project
6. Install all needed packages -> `yarn install:all`
7. Run development server -> `yarn run:dev`
8. That's it, you're ready to develop apps faster than ever before!
9. Not necessary, but you can edit `package.json`, `src/assets/humans.txt` and `README.md`

**Project structure:**

    - `client.js` - client entry point (renders `app/app.jsx` with ReactDOM)
- **`src/server/`** - back-end
    - `config.js` - server configuration (e.g. port, hostname, etc.)
    - `server.js` - server entry point (starts app with Express framework)
- `webpack/` - webpack configurations
    - `dev.config.js` - development configuration
    - `dev.server.js` - development server
    - `prod.config.js` - production configuration
- `.babelrc` - Babel configuration
- `.eslintrc.json` - ESLint configuration
- `.flowconfig` - Flow configuration
